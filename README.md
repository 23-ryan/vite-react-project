This React JS App was developed under the course offered by **Learner's Space**, *Introductory  to Web Development*
<br>

>The duration of the programm 4 weeks.
During those 4 weeks we learnt several basic and important concepts related to web development. 
Also compared various frontend and backend frameworks, according to usage and rendering time.

## Project Details
- The **React-App** consists of **client side rendered** single page web application and working as an issuing system for the inventory products efficiently.

- It consits of a **Navbar** containing the links to visit each and every page present on the web app.
The Web app consists of a home page displaying the rewiews of inventory products and several, a whole section of pages for different categories of products, displaying their price. 

- There is a **Cart** section which contains the details of all the products that are selected for purchase, along with the display of the total amount.<br> To implement this feature **Custom Hooks** were used, which is one of the superior benefit of using react.

## Next JS
At the end we shifted from **React JS App** to [**Next JS App**](https://github.com/23-ryan/next-App) to achieve **search engine optimization** and **server side rendering** to get a better rank in the crawlers index system.
